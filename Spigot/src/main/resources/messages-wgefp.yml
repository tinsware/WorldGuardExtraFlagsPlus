# WorldGuardExtraFlagsPlus Messages Configuration
# This file is located in the WorldGuard plugin folder
# You can customize all messages shown to players here
#
# IMPORTANT: Empty String = Disabled Message
# If you set a message to "" (empty string), that message will be disabled
# and no message will be sent to the player. This is useful if you want to
# silence certain messages while keeping others active.
#
# Example:
#   disable-completely-blocked: ""  # This will disable the blocked item message
#
# Messages are cached on plugin load for better performance.
# Use /wg reload or /wgefp reload (or /wgefplus reload or /worldguardextraflagsplus reload) to reload messages without restarting the server.
#
# Placeholders:
#   {required} - The required level/threshold value
#   {current}  - The player's current level/value
#   {item}     - The item name that was blocked
#
# Message Cooldown:
#   Prevents message spam by adding a cooldown between messages sent to the same player.
#   Set to 0 to disable cooldown (messages will always be sent).
#   Default: 3 seconds
send-message-cooldown: 3
